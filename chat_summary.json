They also suggest implementing features such as a UI widget for Uniswap-style swaps, altering color themes to pink to resemble Uniswap's branding more closely, and adding details akin to Uniswap's design complexity. The AI offers a variety of additional features for consideration, including interactive maps for dog walking, profile customization, scheduling calendars, and notification alerts. The user explicitly requests the replacement with a component for a dropdown form. The conversation also touches on customizing the application's theme, with the user being queried about preferences for applying the theme across the entire app or selectively, and whether to adhere to a specific hue of purple or opt for the AI's suggestions. Further, they are asked about preferences for pink shades echoing Uniswap's branding, design complexity, and the inclusion of specific UI elements for detailed likeness to Uniswap. The AI acknowledges the requests, indicating ongoing work to add the requested features and styling adjustments.",
