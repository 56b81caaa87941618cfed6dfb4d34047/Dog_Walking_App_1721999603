The AI then asked for clarification on two fronts: if a specific shade of pink was preferred and whether the user was requesting specific UI elements or an overall design complexity emulating Uniswap. The user was also presented with a list of additional features, like implementing a dropdown form component and integrating various user interface elements including an interactive map for dog walking paths, a component for booking dog walks, and a notification system for walk reminders. The AI confirmed the implementation of these components. Moreover, the user showed interest in adding a yellow box for displaying alerts or additional information within the app, to which the AI also agreed. In addition to these features, the user sought to include a UI widget for Uniswap-style swaps, further aligning the project's functionality with that of the Uniswap app. Throughout this interaction, the AI aimed to gather more detailed requirements from the user to better understand the project's scope and specific needs.",
